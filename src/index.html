                <li><strong>Consider Your Priorities:</strong> If the request aligns with your goals or values, it might be worth saying yes. If it distracts from them, it's okay to say no.</li>

                <li><strong>Say "Yes" When It’s a Growth Opportunity:</strong> If a situation challenges you to grow or offers a positive learning experience, consider saying yes even if it's uncomfortable at first.</li>
                <li><strong>Trust Your Gut:</strong> Sometimes, your intuition tells you what the right answer is. Trusting your instincts can help guide your decision-making process.</li>
